## Asymtote: My first blog
I have come here to record and share my experiences and learnings that I have gathered on my journey as a systems researcher.
My learning journey can be divded in largely following facets:

**PreEngineering Eduction:** 

* Things I learnt in school

**Engineering days:** 

* How my understanding shifted with new experiences.

**My Failings:** 

* GATE, CAT, MBA. 
* Not all stories have happy endings, but then there are not failings, only learnings.

**Family Bussiness & Banking:** 

* Not a fun period

**Restarting the career:** 

* This time in IT. 
:warning: systems administration is neither about systems or administration. :warning:
